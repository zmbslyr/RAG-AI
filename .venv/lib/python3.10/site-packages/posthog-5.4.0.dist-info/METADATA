Please see the [Python integration docs](https://posthog.com/docs/integrations/python-integration) for details.

## Development

### Testing Locally

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It's super fast.

1. Run `uv venv env` (creates virtual environment called "env")
    * or `python3 -m venv env`
2. Run `source env/bin/activate` (activates the virtual environment)
3. Run `uv sync --extra dev --extra test` (installs the package in develop mode, along with test dependencies)
    * or `pip install -e ".[dev,test]"`
4. you have to run `pre-commit install` to have auto linting pre commit
5. Run `make test`
  1. To run a specific test do `pytest -k test_no_api_key`

## PostHog recommends `uv` so...

```bash
uv python install 3.9.19
uv python pin 3.9.19
uv venv env
source env/bin/activate
uv sync --extra dev --extra test
pre-commit install
make test
```

### Running Locally

Assuming you have a [local version of PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/developing-locally) running, you can run `python3 example.py` to see the library in action.

### Releasing Versions

Updates are released using GitHub Actions: after bumping `version.py` in `master` and adding to `CHANGELOG.md`, go to [our release workflow's page](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/actions/workflows/release.yaml) and dispatch it manually, using workflow from `master`.


### Testing changes locally with the PostHog app

You can run `make prep_local`, and it'll create a new folder alongside the SDK repo one called `posthog-python-local`, which you can then import into the posthog project by changing pyproject.toml to look like this:
```toml
dependencies = [
    ...
    "posthoganalytics" #NOTE: no version number
    ...
]
...
[tools.uv.sources]
posthoganalytics = { path = "../posthog-python-local" }
```
This'll let you build and test SDK changes fully locally, incorporating them into your local posthog app stack. It mainly takes care of the `posthog -> posthoganalytics` module renaming. You'll need to re-run `make prep_local` each time you make a change, and re-run `uv sync --active` in the posthog app project.
